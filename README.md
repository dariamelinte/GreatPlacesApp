# GreatPlacesApp

This app was created for learning to use **Native Device Features** with **React Native**.

I made this app following a React Native course on Udemy, using React Native packages instead of Expo tools. From this course I understood how to use the **Camera Picker**, the **Maps** and the **Location** options from a mobile device.

> Creating the app with React Native packages made me understand better the inner files of Android and Ios because I had to configure a couple of files in there (example: for requesting permission from the users to acces the Camera or their Location).

I also learned how to work with the Google Maps API, which could be a painfull sometimes. :sweat_smile:

Building this app was also a refresher for my React Navigation package knowledge, working with dynamical Hearder changes.
